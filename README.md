# Light-Measurement-Instrument-Using-LDR-and-Arduino


The purpose of this project is to measure the intensity of light in a given location. The application of this project is to determine whether hydroponic plants have good light exposure or not (good light exposures is usually between 40-200 lux). The sensor will be able to classify whether the current light intensity is ideal, fairly ideal, or not ideal for hydroponic plants
